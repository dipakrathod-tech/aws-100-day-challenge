# My 100-Day AWS Cloud Challenge

Welcome to the central code repository for my 100-Day AWS Cloud Challenge.

This project is a public journal of my journey from Linux fundamentals to advanced cloud and DevOps engineering. This repository archives all the functional code, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates, shell scripts, and configuration files I create during the challenge.

This repo is the **"codebase,"** but the "why" and "how" are documented across my personal content platforms.
